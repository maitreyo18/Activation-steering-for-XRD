The image shows a circular pattern with a bright ring in the center. This pattern is due to the non-uniform detector used in the X-ray diffraction experiment. In X-ray diffraction, a beam of X-rays is shone onto a sample, and the diffracted X-rays are detected by a detector. However, the detector is not sensitive to X-rays over a wide range of angles, resulting in a non-uniform intensity distribution across the detector. This leads to the appearance of the bright ring in the center of the image.",D
