The image shows loop scattering, which is characterized by a series of concentric rings or circles in the X-ray diffraction pattern, due to the coherent scattering of X-rays by the crystal lattice of the specimen. The presence of an artifact, which appears as a bright circular area in the center of the image, suggests that the specimen has a high density and/or high atomic number. Additionally, the non-uniform detector can cause variations in the intensity of the X-ray diffraction pattern, which can be seen as bright spots in the image. The presence of ice ring can also be observed in the image which is caused due to the presence of ice crystals in the sample."
